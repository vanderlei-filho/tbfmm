abstract = "An algorithm is presented for the rapid evaluation of the potential and force fields in systems involving large numbers of particles whose interactions are Coulombic or gravitational in nature. For a system of N particles, an amount of work of the order O(N2) has traditionally been required to evaluate all pairwise interactions, unless some approximation or truncation method is used. The algorithm of the present paper requires an amount of work proportional to N to evaluate all interactions to within roundoff error, making it considerably more practical for large-scale problems encountered in plasma physics, fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, and celestial mechanics."

 abstract = {
            Task-based programming models have demonstrated their efficiency in the development of scientific applications on modern high-performance platforms. They allow delegation of the management of parallelization to the runtime system (RS), which is in charge of the data coherency, the scheduling, and the assignment of the work to the computational units. However, some applications have a limited degree of parallelism such that no matter how efficient the RS implementation, they may not scale on modern multicore CPUs. In this paper, we propose using speculation to unleash the parallelism when it is uncertain if some tasks will modify data, and we formalize a new methodology to enable speculative execution in a graph of tasks. This description is partially implemented in our new C++ RS called SPETABARU, which is capable of executing tasks in advance if some others are not certain to modify the data. We study the behavior of our approach to compute Monte Carlo and replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations.

abstract = {Summary High performance fast multipole method is crucial for the numerical simulation of many physical problems. In a previous study, we have shown that task-based fast multipole method provides the flexibility required to process a wide spectrum of particle distributions efficiently on multicore architectures. In this paper, we now show how such an approach can be extended to fully exploit heterogeneous platforms. For that, we design highly tuned graphics processing unit (GPU) versions of the two dominant operators P2P and M2L) as well as a scheduling strategy that dynamically decides which proportion of subsequent tasks is processed on regular CPU cores and on GPU accelerators. We assess our method with the StarPU runtime system for executing the resulting task flow on an Intel X5650 Nehalem multicore processor possibly enhanced with one, two, or three Nvidia Fermi M2070 or M2090 GPUs (Santa Clara, CA, USA). A detailed experimental study on two 30 million particle distributions (a cube and an ellipsoid) shows that the resulting software consistently achieves high performance across architectures.

An adaptive truncation scheme for the expansion of the 2D Laplace Green function is proposed. A linear time harmonic test case is considered. The results obtained with the hybrid model, with and without fast multipole acceleration, agree well with those obtained with a finite element model. The computational cost of the three calculations is compared and discussed. The proposed adaptive truncation scheme significantly contributes to the computation time savings achieved with the fast multipole method, particularly when dealing with moderate sized problems."
